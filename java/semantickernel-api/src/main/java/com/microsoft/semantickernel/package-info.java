 * The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/">Semantic Kernel</a>)
 * for Java SDK provides an easy way to integrate Java applications with Large Language Models (LLMs).
 * Central to the Semantic Kernel API are 
 * <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins">plugins</a> 
 * which allow you to make use of your business logic within the context of a chat or text completion.
 *  the LLM.
 * [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction),
 * [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service),
 * and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
 * with conventional programming languages like C#, Python, and Java. Semantic Kernel achieves this
 * by allowing you to define [plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins)
 * that can be chained together
 * in just a [few lines of code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chaining-functions?tabs=Csharp#using-the-runasync-method-to-simplify-your-code).
 *
 * What makes Semantic Kernel _special_, however, is its ability to _automatically_ orchestrate
 * plugins with AI. With Semantic Kernel
 * [planners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/planner), you
 * can ask an LLM to generate a plan that achieves a user's unique goal. Afterwards,
 * Semantic Kernel will execute the plan for the user.
